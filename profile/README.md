üëã Welcome to our project! Our [documentation](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/) will help you get started and provides an in-depth information about the projects and the features.

## ‚ú® What is Project Sveltos?

[Sveltos](https://github.com/projectsveltos "Manage Kubernetes add-ons") is a Kubernetes **add-on controller** that simplifies the deployment and management of Kubernetes **add-ons** and **applications** across **multiple** clusters whether on-prem, in the cloud or a multitenant environment.

Sveltos runs in a **management cluster**. It assists users in programmatically deploying and managing Kubernetes add-ons and applications to **any** cluster in the fleet, including the management cluster.

Sveltos supports a variety of add-on formats, including **Helm charts**, raw **YAML/JSON**, **Kustomize**, **Carvel ytt**, and **Jsonnet**.

## Features

* **Observability**: Sveltos offers different endpoints for notifications. The notifications can be used by other tools to perform additional actions or trigger workflows. The supported types are Slack, Teams, Discord, WebEx, and Kubernetes events.
* **Templating**: Patching the rendered resources made easy! Sveltos allows Kubernetes add-ons and applications to be represented as templates. Before deploying to the **managed** clusters, Sveltos instantiates the templates with information gathered from either the **management** or the **managed** clusters. This allows consistent definition across multiple clusters with minimal adjustments and administration overhead.
* **Orchestrated Deployment Order**: The Sveltos CRDs (Custom Resource Definition) are deployed in the exact order they appear in the definition file. That ensures a predictable and controlled deployment order.
* **Multitenancy**: Sveltos was created with the multitenancy concept in mind.Sveltos `ClusterProfile` and `Profile` resources allow platform administrators to facilitate full isolation or tenants sharing a cluster.
* **Events**: `Sveltos Event Framework` allows the deployment of add-ons and applications in response to specific events with the use of the [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) language. That allows dynamic and adaptable deployments based on different needs and use cases.
* [**Managed Services**](https://projectsveltos.github.io/sveltos/events/managed-services/) 

## Why Sveltos?

Sveltos was built to address the challenges posed by various CI/CD tools. Sveltos was designed to complement or even replace existing GitOps tools, and its integration with **Flux CD** significantly enhances the GitOps approach at scale.

Key features of Sveltos include multitenancy, agent-based drift notification and synchronisation, and resource optimisation. These features ensure **secure**, **reliable**, and **stable** deployments of Kubernetes add-ons and applications, while reducing operational costs in both on-prem and cloud environments.
